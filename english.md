# Manifesto for Abundant Love
We are uncovering ways to improve intimate relationships by doing it and helping others do it.
Through this work we have come to value:
1. **Honesty and trust** instead of rules and limits
2. **Atention and presence** instead of dreams and fantasies
3. **Clear communication** instead of comfortable silence
4. **Affection** instead of expectations
5. **Forgiving fast** instead of beeing right
6. **Desire** instead of obligation
7. **Act** instead of promise
8. **Love and respect** instead of entitlement 

That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.
