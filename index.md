We are uncovering ways to improve intimate relationships by doing it and helping others do it.

Through this work we have come to value:

1. **Honesty and trust** over rules and limits
2. **Attention and presence** over dreams and fantasies
3. **Clear communication** over comfortable silence
4. **Affection** over expectations
5. **Forgiving fast** over being right
6. **Desire** over obligation
7. **Act** over promise
8. **Love and respect** over entitlement 

That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.
